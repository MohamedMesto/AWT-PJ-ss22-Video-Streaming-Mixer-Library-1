\section{\textbf{Conclusions}}\label{sec:conclusions}

As a result of this project, users can enjoy, for example, a complete TV series in a single sit without interrupting the experience by refreshing the page for the next episode. Multiple streams can be played as a single one as long as they have matching resolutions and audio format.

This last feature is a future work that needs to be implemented and is considered a limitation in this present proof of concept as mentioned in the Discussion section, as well as multiple audio support where the user can choose, for example, which language audio to play.

Hls-parser was easy to work with and very intuitive. Some challenges were present when playlist URLs are in relative path format, so they had to be parsed and joined with the original stream address. In the initial stages of testing, video playback errors were present until further research discovered that the Discontinuity tag, mentioned in the Results section, was needed to have a smooth transition between streams.

The video mixer library leads to the beginning of a new era of streaming technologies, having as a goal to improve the user experience and, tentatively, to attach them to the web page for them to be exposed to more ads which leads to market profits.
