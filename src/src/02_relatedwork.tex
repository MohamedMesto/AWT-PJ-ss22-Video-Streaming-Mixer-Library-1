In order to create e.g. playlists consisting of multiple existing different video streams it is needed to make sure that the different video stream sources are all compatible in regards to video resolution and bitrate and can be combined into a single video stream.
Your tasks:
Parse input HLS manifests into fitting object representation
Design and implement an algorithm that identifies matching representations based on e.g. resolution, bitrate etc. 
Output must be a HLS manifest including all compatible inputs that matched
Implement as a library component that can be used in other applications as a dependency
Implement at least two separate strategies/algorithms for matching
Given an array of manifest inputs, all representations/tracks from the first manifest input need to be in the output manifest and only include the other manifest inputs if matching presentations are found
The output manifest must contain only the intersection of all representations, if nothing matches the output could be empty
Print warning messages on console for non-matching representations, print error messages to console in case nothing matched, etc
